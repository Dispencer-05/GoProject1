## Overview

This program demonstrates object-oriented programming by implementing a virtual bank
with different types of accounts that customers can use/interact with, and demonstrates
their differing functionality in main.

## Reflection

Write a two paragraph reflection describing your experience with this
project.  Talk about what worked well and what was challenging.  
Did you run into an issue that took some time to figure out?  
Tell us about it. What did you enjoy, what was less desirable? Feel
free to add other items (within the two paragraph limit).

This project was really annoying for me for one reason: the timing of
it all. I had to manage a debate tournament that took up much of the 
time that I would have used to work on this project. I managed to finish
however, and overall I can say that this project wasn't too difficult since
we were working with a concept that was already fully realized in Java, we
just had to port it to go. This is generally a simpler premise than many
CS projects I've done in the past.

The most annoying part of getting all of this to work was the import process
for my packages. As of writing this I still haven't gotten that part figured out
but wanted to honor the deadline that we agreed to. Using interfaces as pseudo-
abstract classes was interesting.
